OOP using Python review and reference

Inheritance
- the process by which one class (child) takes on the attributes and methods of another class (parent)
- child classes inherit all of the parent's class attributes and methods
- child classes can also extend and overwrite attributes and methods that are unique to themeselves

Polymorphism
- "Many shapes" or "many forms"
- we can write a code that works on the superclass and work with any child class also
- gives a way to use a class exactly like its parent, but each child class keeps its own methods 

Encapsulation
- mechanism of hiding data implementation
- instance variables are kept private and access is restricted to accessor methods
- accessor methods (setter and getter) are made public
- instance methods can also be kept private

Abstraction
- natural extension of encapsulation
- means that object should only expose high-level mechanism for using it
- mechanism should hide internal implementation details
