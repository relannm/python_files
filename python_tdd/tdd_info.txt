# TDD -> Test Driven Development
# Steps:
#   1. Write tests
#   2. Run the test -> and make sure they all FAIL
#   3. Write the actual code -> to make the tests PASS (it doesn't have to be perfect, just make sure it follow specs.)
#   4. Make ALL tests PASS
#   5. Refactor and improve (red/green refactor) -> while test harness is always running
#   6. Back to step 1
# Benefits:
#   1. Forces developers to think requirement first
#   2. Although more coding is needed, it saves time a lot of time because bugs are detected earlier
#           (sometime debugging takes a lot of time)
#   3. If you start by writing tests, you always write testable code (thus code are easy to extend and maintain)
# Disadvantages:
#   1. Writing and maintaining lots of tests takes time
#   2. False sense of security (when you've written lots of passing tests, you might neglect other tests ex: IT)
#   3. If tests are written in the wrong way, implementation will also be wrong (and it is hard to find the error)
# 
#
# 7 Testing Principles
# 1. Testing shows the presence of defects, not their absence
# 2. Exhaustive testing is impossible
# 3. Early testing saves time and money
# 4. Defects cluster together
# 5. Beware of the pesticide paradox
# 6. Testing is context dependent
# 7. Absence of error fallacy
